        <p>My name is Andrea Herrera, I was born on April 23rd, 1994 in Caracas,Venezuela.I can say that my passion for
        animation started at an early age.  I can still remeber waking up early every saturday to watch the saturday cartoons.
        Although, I never thought I would end up doing cartoons for a living, I always had a passion for them.
        What I love about animation is the ability to create a character and see it come to life little by little as well as 
        seeing the character's personality shape out.
